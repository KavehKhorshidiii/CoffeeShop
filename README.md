## 📄 Description

The coffee shop project is my first project

## 📘 Project Description

This is my **first personal project**, built with **Next.js**, even though I haven't formally learned the framework yet. The goal was to explore web development hands-on and practice building a simple coffee shop management app.  
I'm still learning, and this project is part of my journey.
